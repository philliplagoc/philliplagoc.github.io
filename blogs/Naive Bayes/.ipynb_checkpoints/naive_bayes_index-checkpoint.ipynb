    "# A Short Introduction to the Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we are looking at different teams, Team A and Team B, and the conditions in which they win or lose. Let’s say there are two conditions under which Team A and Team B play: the weather is clear or snowy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to do is predict whether Team A or Team B wins in their next game. A simple way to do this would be to use a Naive Bayes Classifier, which uses the famous [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) to calculate the probability that a team wins given certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what __Bayes Theorem__ looks like: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y|x) = \\frac{P(x|y)P(y)}{\\sum_{k=1}^n(P(x_{k}|y)P(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what each value means:\n",
    "- $P(y|x)$: This is the probability that we wish to calculate. This means “the probability of y happening given x has happened. In our case, this would mean the “the probability that Team y wins given a condition x. Another name for this is the __posterior probability__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(x|y)$: This means “the probability of x happening given y happened”, or “the probability that it condition x happens given Team y won”. This is referred to as the __likelihood__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(y)$: This just refers to the probability that Team y won. When multiplied with the likelihood, the numerator becomes the __prior probability__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sum_{k=1}^n(P(x_{k}|y)P(y)$: This means to add all of the prior probabilities for each conditions. When calculated, it becomes $P(x)$, or “the probability that condition x occurs”. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a grasp on how to use Bayes Theorem, let’s use the Naive Bayes Classifier from scikit-learn to check if our math is right and make more predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook and scikit-learn installed. Here are instructions for [how to install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and on [how to install scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html). \n",
